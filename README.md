## Introduction

detrex is an open-source toolbox that provides state-of-the-art Transformer-based detection algorithms. It is built on top of [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) and its module design is partially borrowed from [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) and [DETR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr). Many thanks for their nicely organized code. The main branch works with **Pytorch 1.10+** or higher (we recommend **Pytorch 1.12**).

<summary> Major Features </summary>

- **Modular Design.** detrex decomposes the Transformer-based detection framework into various components which help users easily build their own customized models.

- **State-of-the-art Methods.** detrex provides a series of Transformer-based detection algorithms, including [DINO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03605) which reached the SOTA of DETR-like models with **63.3mAP**!

- **Easy to Use.** detrex is designed to be **light-weight** and easy for users to use:
  - [LazyConfig System](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/lazyconfigs.html) for more flexible syntax and cleaner config files.
  - Light-weight [training engine](./tools/train_net.py) modified from detectron2 [lazyconfig_train_net.py](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/main/tools/lazyconfig_train_net.py)

Apart from detrex, we also released a repo [Awesome Detection Transformer](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/awesome-detection-transformer) to present papers about Transformer for detection and segmentation.

## Fun Facts
The repo name detrex has several interpretations:
- <font color=blue> <b> detr-ex </b> </font>: We take our hats off to DETR and regard this repo as an extension of Transformer-based detection algorithms.

- <font color=#db7093> <b> det-rex </b> </font>: rex literally means 'king' in Latin. We hope this repo can help advance the state of the art on object detection by providing the best Transformer-based detection algorithms from the research community.

- <font color=#008000> <b> de-t.rex </b> </font>: de means 'the' in Dutch. T.rex, also called Tyrannosaurus Rex, means 'king of the tyrant lizards' and connects to our research work 'DINO', which is short for Dinosaur.

## What's New
v0.1.1 was released on 18/10/2022:
- Add model analysis tools and benchmark in [tools](./tools/).
- Support visualization on COCO eval results and annotations in [tools](./tools/)
- Support [Group-DETR](./projects/group_detr/).
- Release more DINO training results including `DINO-R50-24epochs`, `DINO-R101`, `DINO-Swin-Tiny`, `DINO-Swin-Small`, `DINO-Swin-Base`, `DINO-Swin-Large` in [DINO](./projects/dino/).
- Release better `Deformable-DETR` baselines with **48.2 AP** on COCO dataset in [Deformable-DETR](./projects/deformable_detr/).
