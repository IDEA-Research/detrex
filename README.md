## Introduction

detrex is an open-source toolbox that provides state-of-the-art Transformer-based detection algorithms. It is built on top of [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) and its module design is partially borrowed from [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) and [DETR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr). Many thanks for their nicely organized code. The main branch works with **Pytorch 1.10+** or higher (we recommend **Pytorch 1.12**).

<summary> Major Features </summary>

- **Modular Design.** detrex decomposes the Transformer-based detection framework into various components which help users easily build their own customized models.

- **State-of-the-art Methods.** detrex provides a series of Transformer-based detection algorithms, including [DINO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03605) which reached the SOTA of DETR-like models with **63.3AP**!

- **Easy to Use.** detrex is designed to be **light-weight** and easy for users to use:
  - [LazyConfig System](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/lazyconfigs.html) for more flexible syntax and cleaner config files.
  - Light-weight [training engine](./tools/train_net.py) modified from detectron2 [lazyconfig_train_net.py](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/main/tools/lazyconfig_train_net.py)

Apart from detrex, we also released a repo [Awesome Detection Transformer](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/awesome-detection-transformer) to present papers about Transformer for detection and segmentation.

## Fun Facts
The repo name detrex has several interpretations:
- <font color=blue> <b> detr-ex </b> </font>: We take our hats off to DETR and regard this repo as an extension of Transformer-based detection algorithms.

- <font color=#db7093> <b> det-rex </b> </font>: rex literally means 'king' in Latin. We hope this repo can help advance the state of the art on object detection by providing the best Transformer-based detection algorithms from the research community.

- <font color=#008000> <b> de-t.rex </b> </font>: de means 'the' in Dutch. T.rex, also called Tyrannosaurus Rex, means 'king of the tyrant lizards' and connects to our research work 'DINO', which is short for Dinosaur.

## What's New
v0.3.0 was released on 03/17/2023:
- Support new algorithms including `Anchor-DETR` and `DETA`.
- Release more than 10+ pretrained models (including the converted weights): `DETR-R50 & R101`, `DETR-R50 & R101-DC5`, `DAB-DETR-R50 & R101-DC5`, `DAB-DETR-R50-3patterns`, `Conditional-DETR-R50 & R101-DC5`, `DN-DETR-R50-DC5`, `Anchor-DETR` and the `DETA-Swin-o365-finetune` model which can achieve **`62.9AP`** on coco val.
- Support **MaskDINO** on ADE20k semantic segmentation task.
- Support `EMAHook` during training by setting `train.model_ema.enabled=True`, which can enhance the model performance. DINO with EMA can achieve **`49.4AP`** with only 12epoch training.
- Support mixed precision training by setting `train.amp.enabled=True`, which will **reduce 20% to 30% GPU memory usage**.
- Support `train.fast_dev_run=True` for **fast debugging**.
- Support **encoder-decoder checkpoint** in DINO, which may reduce **30% GPU** memory usage.
- Support a great `slurm training scripts` by @rayleizhu, please check this issue for more details [#213](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/detrex/issues/213)

- [How to convert the pretrained weights from original detr repo into detrex format](https://detrex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Converters.html)
- [Visualize your training data and testing results on COCO dataset](https://detrex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Tools.html#visualization)
- [Analyze the model under detrex](https://detrex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Tools.html#model-analysis)
- [Download and initialize with the pretrained backbone weights](https://detrex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Using_Pretrained_Backbone.html)
- [Frequently asked questions](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/detrex/issues/109)
- [A simple onnx convert tutorial provided by powermano](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/detrex/issues/192)
- Simple training techniques: [Model-EMA](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/detrex/pull/201), [Mixed Precision Training](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/detrex/pull/198), [Activation Checkpoint](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/detrex/pull/200)
- [Simple tutorial about custom dataset training](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/detrex/pull/187)

Although some of the tutorials are currently presented with relatively simple content, we will constantly improve our documentation to help users achieve a better user experience.
