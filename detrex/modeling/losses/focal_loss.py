    Loss used in RetinaNet for dense detection: https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002.

    Args:
        inputs (torch.Tensor): A float tensor of arbitrary shape.
            The predictions for each example.
        targets (torch.Tensor): A float tensor with the same shape as inputs. Stores the binary
            classification label for each element in inputs
            (0 for the negative class and 1 for the positive class).
        num_boxes (int): The number of boxes.
        alpha (float, optional): Weighting factor in range (0, 1) to balance
            positive vs negative examples. Default: 0.25.
        gamma (float): Exponent of the modulating factor (1 - p_t) to
            balance easy vs hard examples. Default: 2.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: The computed sigmoid focal loss.
