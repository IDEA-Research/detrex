        inputs: A float tensor of arbitrary shape.
                The predictions for each example.
        targets: A float tensor with the same shape as inputs. Stores the binary
                 classification label for each element in inputs
                (0 for the negative class and 1 for the positive class).
        alpha: (optional) Weighting factor in range (0,1) to balance
                positive vs negative examples. Default = -1 (no weighting).
        gamma: Exponent of the modulating factor (1 - p_t) to
               balance easy vs hard examples.
